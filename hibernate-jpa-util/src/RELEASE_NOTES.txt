Release 1.1 (2008/06)
-----------------------
Bug fixed :
    - Merge error when changing association on client side

    - Correction of the abstract LazyPojo (without GWT) class

Improvement :
    - Compatibility with both GWT 1.4 and GWT 1.5
    - Merge update with new beanLib version
    - Clone and merge of wrapping classes (ie non persistent instance having persistent members)
    - Dynamic proxy additional code is read from xml file (LazyPojo.java14.xml and LazyPojo.java5.xml)
   
Known issue : 
    - Does not work with Hibernate natural IDs
     
Other :
    - Needs BeanLib version 3.3beta16

Release 1.0.4 (2008/03)
-----------------------
Bug fixed :
    - Map merge issue
    - Better proxy handling (when session.load() is used instead of session.get())
    - DirectoryClassMapper : bug when dto and domain directories are nested
    - BeanlibThreadLocal : bad Integer destination bean (the merge list contains Integer instances instead of beans)
    - Bad initialization of PersistentSet on merge (merged collection members modifications are lost)
    - Tomcat/Javassist classloader issue with dynamic proxy mode 
    - Stateless Pojo Store : Hibernate session was not closed when mergePojo threw an exception
    - Component class handling
    
Improvement :
    - Merge property in not null, even if it was lazy but not loaded at clone
    - HibernateHelper becomes HibernateUtil and is no longer used as a singleton (multi-database enable)
   
Known issue : 
    - Does not work with Hibernate natural IDs
     
Other :
	- Needs the new BeanLib version (3.3alpha12) for solving "merge of beans with the same abstract class" issue

	- GWT 1.4 only

Release 1.0 (2007/10)

New features :
	- GWT dynamic proxy generation for Serializable objects

Bug fixed :
	- Better collection support for clone and merge (including set and map)

    - Add JPA EntityManager support to HibernateLazyManager (works only with Hibernate implementation)
	
Other :
	- Needs the new BeanLib version (3.3beta10) for solving javassist proxy clone issue
	- GWT 1.4 only

---------------------
New features :
	- LazyGwtPojo implements the Serializable interface instead of IsSerializable
	- Full support for java.sql.Timestamp & java.sql.Date

	- Basic support for Java5 Hibernate POJO (dynamic DTO conversion)

Bug fixed :
	- Correct handling protected and private setters for ID
	
Improvements :
    - Remove the HTTPServletRequest argument from the POJO stores and clone/merge/remove methods of HibernatenLazyManager
      (use of ThreadLocal to store it)
    - Unique name generator : no more name parameter for clone/merge/remove methods.
    - Better exception handling
	
Other :
	- Needs the new BeanLib version (3.3beta8) for solving 'char' attribute cloning
	- GWT 1.4 only

Release 0.2 (2007/05)
---------------------
New features :
	- Add list support for clone, merge and remove in LazyManager and HibernateRemoteService classes
	- Pure POJO handling for stateful Pojo stores (no more ILazyPojo inheritance)

Bug fixed :
	- java.sql.Timestamp conversion to prevent GWT RPC Serialization exception.
	  WARNING : the Timestamp is converted to Date so the nano part is lost. 
	  DO NOT USE TIMESTAMP FOR VERSION MANAGEMENT (OPTIMISTIC LOCK) !

	- Lot of code refactoring
	- Documentation update
	- Use of new BeanLib version (3.3beta5)
